I wasn't initially going to include Fuze4NS in this project
for two reasons.

1. Fuze4 is currently only available on Nintendo Switch,
so I would have to copy everything out by hand.

1. Fuze4 is designed with graphics in mind, so the
console-based quiz application wouldn't work exactly as
the other languages do.

But then I decided to do it anyway :)

If you want to see what Fuze4NS is really capable of,
I highly recommend checking out the [Fuze Arena YouTube Channel]("https://youtube.com/@FUZEArena").
